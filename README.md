# Random-Number-Generator
Linear Congruential Method is a class of Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) algorithms used for generating sequences of random-like numbers in a specific range. 


This is an implementation of the Linear Congruential pseudo-random number generation (PRNG) algorithm in javascript. The intent of this project is to help me understand the effect of different seed and shift values on the outcome (i.e. the apparent randomness) of this PRNG
